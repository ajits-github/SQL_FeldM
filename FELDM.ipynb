For example, if we want to add support for MySQL or PostgreSQL, the drivers related to them have to be kept ready and also, the queries have to be migrated. At any cost, we cannot keep the same queries for each DBMS and has to be changed based on the selected database. For this kind of requirement, there's a library based on Python called **PyQt**:\n","\n","*   Use PyQt’s SQL support to reliably connect to a database\n","*   Execute SQL queries on a database using PyQt\n","*   Use PyQt’s Model-View architecture in database applications\n","*   Display and edit data using different PyQt widgets\n","\n","In PyQt, you can create a database connection by using the QSqlDatabase class. This class represents a connection and provides an interface for accessing the database. To create a connection, just call .addDatabase() on QSqlDatabase.\n","\n","\n","```\n","QSqlDatabase.addDatabase(\n","    driver, connectionName=QSqlDatabase.defaultConnection\n",")\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","A call to .addDatabase() adds a database connection to a list of available connections.
